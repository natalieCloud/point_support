This file records the results of testing various custom created pcd files of both varying number of points distributed (num_points), and the size and space over which those points have been distributed (length x width and x,y,z center coordinate)

The .pcd files generated by this have been made to run inside the ros2 reach demo at: https://github.com/ros-industrial/reach_ros2

IMPORTANT NOTES: These test results are the result of running these various files on my local machine (LINUX UBUNTU 22.04.2), and running reach_ros2 with ROS 2 Humble
