# reach_support_files README

This repository contains various programs that aided in the testing of the limits of ROS-Industrial's [Reach Package](https://github.com/ros-industrial/reach_ros2) 
The goal was to create various programs that would aid in the linkage between the reach package and the path planning to get the most optimized results between the robot and the path planned!

As of now this package contains the [**point_support**](https://github.com/natalieCloud/reach_support_files/tree/main/point_support) and [**reach_study**](https://github.com/natalieCloud/reach_support_files/tree/main/reach_study) packages. 

The **point_support** package allows conversion of user input to a text file, and then a (either user created or inner package created) txt file into a pcd mesh file! 

The **reach_study** package contains the msxg files that allow the linkage of a PoseArray to its associated reachability scores! 

:D
